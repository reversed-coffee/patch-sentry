# patch-sentry

This repository contains a program that I have written before/during the CyberPatriot XVI competition to quickly
patch vulnerabilities in Windows systems, avoiding the need to click on 200 things to get a simple task done.

The primary motivation behind this program was to save as much time as possible by ruling out the obvious flaws
and allocating more time to what needs attention. Development may continue in the next competition.
